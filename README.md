A repository to transform images in diverse shapes


### Shapes

# Circle shapes

- Currently the code involves transforming an image in circle shapes of specific size defined by the py file. A GUI option can be added to handle that.

- Currently the code runs a little slow, but I believe it can be sped up using CuPy.
